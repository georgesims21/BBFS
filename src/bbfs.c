  The point of this FUSE filesystem is to provide an introduction to
  FUSE.  It was my first FUSE filesystem as I got to know the
  software; hopefully, the comments in this code will help people who
  follow later to get a gentler introduction.

  This might be called a no-op filesystem:  it doesn't impose
  filesystem semantics on top of any other existing structure.  It
  simply reports the requests that come in, and passes them to an
  underlying filesystem.  The information is saved in a logfile named
  bbfs.log, in the directory from which you run bbfs.

 * has cached dirty data, this is a good place to write back data
 * and return any errors.  Since many applications ignore close()
 * errors this is not always useful.
 *
 * NOTE: The flush() method may be called more than once for each
 * open().  This happens if more than one file descriptor refers
 * to an opened file due to dup(), dup2() or fork() calls.  It is
 * not possible to determine if a flush is final, so each flush
 * should be treated equally.  Multiple write-flush sequences are
 * relatively rare, so this shouldn't be a problem.

 * after some writes, or that if will be called at all.

 * 2) The readdir implementation keeps track of the offsets of the
 * directory entries.  It uses the offset parameter and always

 * is full (or an error happens) the filler function will return
